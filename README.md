<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


There are many great MVC Frameworks available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really let me know how things work so I built this SIMPLE MVC framework. -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others.
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a Validations, Authentications from scratch

### Built With

* [PHP](https://www.php.net)
* MYSQL database


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an instruction about how to get the Framework and modify it to work perfectly on your device.

### Prerequisites

* PHP
* XAMPP (Optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/realMoSalah/Anyns-feed.git
   ```

2. Enter your directory name in `App\Config.php`
   ```PHP
   const directory = 'ENTER YOUR DIRECTORY NAME';
   ```
3. On Production Enviroment change localEnviroment in 'App\Config.php'
   ```PHP
   const localEnviroment = FALSE;
   ```


4. That's it! :smile:


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

* If you use XAMPP your can directly by starting Apache
* You can start using php built in server by typing this on terminal
   ```sh
   cd YOUR_PROJECT_PATH
   php -S 127.1.1.0:3000
   ```
  Your Server Will listen on port 3000 (You can change the port)
